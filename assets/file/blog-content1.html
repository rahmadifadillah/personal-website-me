            <p>React Native is a mobile app development framework that allows developers to build apps that render
                natively in Android and iOS. The principle of “code once, run everywhere” is an inherent trait of the
                framework. React Native also shares many similarities with React, so developers who work in React can
                quickly pick up React Native.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to all these great features, it's all JavaScript under the hood. JavaScript can be used to
                write backend code in Node.js. Therefore, JavaScript developers are in a unique position of being able
                to build apps, web apps, and server-side code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In this guide, we’ll build a full-stack app for uploading videos on React Native to Firebase using
                Multer, a Node.js middleware that handles file uploads.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Setting up Firebase</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Firebase is a Google backed app development platform. It provides several services for building and
                scaling apps, including a real-time database, authentication, and hosting. The first step of our
                tutorial is creating a Firebase account, if you don’t already have one. Once you’ve done that, click on
                the Create a Project button Give the project a name, which will be used later to identify the storage
                bucket in use. Once you’ve created your project, you need to choose the test environment. Please note
                that when deploying to production, you will need to choose a production environment and restrict access
                to your files. On the Project settings dashboard, click on the Service accounts tab and generate private
                keys.</p><br>
            <h3>Setting up the backend Node.js server</h3><br>
            <p>The backend will hold the API logic that will interface with React Native. The API will have two
                endpoints; one for retrieving all video files from Firebase and one for uploading images to Firebase.
                The controllers folder holds the business logic for handling uploads and retrieval of videos. The routes
                folder specifies the structure of the Express route that will direct traffic to the right controller.
                package.json will contain the version used for all our dependencies, and server.js will be the entry
                point that spins up an Express server and handles route requests. Finally, serviceAccountKey.json holds
                the Firebase config we downloaded earlier. The above function utilizes the Multer upload middleware to
                process the incoming file and store it as a buffer in memory. Errors on uploading are logged to the
                console. On successful upload, the buffer is saved to a file on the file system with a temporary name.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In this article, we explored how to upload videos from a React Native app. React Native is a powerful
                tool when building cross-platform tools. Using the same codebase, we can have two separate apps running
                on different operating systems. Learning React Native is a superpower in itself. The full code for this
                project is available on GitHub.</p>
