            <p>Hello, my name is Rahmadi Fadillah. I am a 3rd year information system student at Triogi University,
                Jakarta. While on campus, I was active in campus organization activities. I have work experience with 2
                years experience in Retail industry. I have expertise in software management and development and have
                successfully completed many projects and assignments well. I am dedicated to continuously improving my
                skills and knowledge, and always trying to provide the best results for my clients or team. I enjoy
                working in a dynamic and challenging environment and have the ability to work in a team or
                independently. Besides that, I also have an interest in the IT field, therefore I want to become a
                full-stack developer software engineer. I have a hobby of playing soccer which helps me maintain a
                balance in life and broaden my horizons in carrying out work assignments. If you want me to join your
                team, please contact me.</p>
